### Recent Company News

1. **Political Tensions**:
   - On July 7, 2025, Elon Musk announced the formation of a new political party named the "America Party," which served to heighten tensions with President Donald Trump.

3. **Q2 Financial Performance**:
   - Tesla's Q2 2025 report showed a stable operational performance with over 384,000 vehicle deliveries and energy storage deployments of 9.6 GWh. This news marked continued growth and operational efficiency, which analysts viewed as promising for the company's long-term value.

4. **Public Sentiment**:
   - The proposal by CFRA analyst Dan Ives for a new incentives-driven pay package for Musk attracted attention, leading to a mixed bag of responses from the public, especially given Musk's dismissive rebuttal on social media.
