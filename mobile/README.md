# Mobile App

This directory contains the Flutter front-end for **LetAgents_DYOR**.

## Running

1. Install Flutter 3.x on your system.
2. From this directory run:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter run --dart-define=BACKEND_URL=http://<backend-ip>:8000
   ```
   Replace `<backend-ip>` with the host where the FastAPI backend is running.

The app acts as the user interface to the multi-agent trading framework and displays the results generated by the backend.
